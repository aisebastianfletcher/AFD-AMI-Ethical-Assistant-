# AFD∞-AMI Ethical Assistant

![Demo GIF](images/demo.gif)

A groundbreaking realtime AI assistant combining AFD∞ (self-reflective meta-agent) and AMI (AFD + LLM Ethical Interpreter) for provable, human-like ethical reasoning. A prototype for self-correcting AGI, deployed live as of 01:30 AM BST, October 09, 2025.

## Demo
See it in action: [https://share.streamlit.io/yourusername/AFD∞-AMI-Ethical-Assistant/main/app.py](URL to be generated on Streamlit Sharing)

## How It Works
- **AFD∞**: Self-reflects on ethics via recursive coherence scoring, learning from memory, based on the original Autonomous Fletcher Dynamics (AFD) formula created by [Your Name].
- **AMI**: Filters LLM translations with AFD’s non-reward-based moral framework.
See [AFD_Paper.pdf](AFD_Paper.pdf) for details.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AFD∞-AMI-Ethical-Assistant.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run locally: `streamlit run app.py`

## Usage
- Input prompts in the web app to see ethical responses and self-reflection.
- Memory-based learning adjusts responses over time.
